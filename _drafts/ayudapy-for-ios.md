AyudaPY for iOS is the mobile version of [AyudaPY.org](https://ayudapy.org), an awesome platform for "helping people help people" created by [Marcelo Elizeche Land√≥](https://melizeche.com/) with the support of awesome guys in the tech area from my country.

The platform allows people to ask for help describing their needs and for supporters to find them geo-localized and eventually helping them. I though that it was a simple and great idea so decided to create my own version of the platform giving the use of the mobile device.

The main idea of this project was to give the user a vision of the needs on their neighborhoods... that's why, the main screen is the user location showing the needs around his zone ( of course users can then explore their city and look if he can help others ).

Due to the amount of "ask for help" being registered on the platform, I though that it would be great to add a personal "Pending for Help" list, so the user can return later and get the info to help that person/family when it can.

Later, I decided to add a "Mark as DONE" button, so the user avoid contacting again with any person by mistake or maybe later, send to the platform and inform the system that it should be marked as ATTENDED.
