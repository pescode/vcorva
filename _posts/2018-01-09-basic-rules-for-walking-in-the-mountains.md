After a long time out of game development, I got the opportunity to come back with this educational game made with Unity/WebGL for [Legends of Learning](legendsoflearning.com).

The game is about FRACTIONS

It's a 2D game with nice animations.

It has 4 different mini games to play with while learning the concepts of fractions.
