excerpt: A mobile APP made with SwiftUI

AyudaPY for iOS is a mobile version for [AyudaPY.org](https://ayudapy.org), an awesome platform for "helping people help people" created by [Marcelo Elizeche Land√≥](https://melizeche.com/) with the support of awesome guys in the tech area of my country.

This APP was made with SwiftUI, it has some nice and smooth animations.

The objective of this app is to show the user all the help request near him.

I've focused in the FORM for registering help, I wanted that form to be fast, agile, comfortable, and I believe that I made it (I wanted it to be as similar as possible as Reflecty APP)... Currently the platform don't have a POST service yet to use so in the meantime I'm just redirecting to the web form.
